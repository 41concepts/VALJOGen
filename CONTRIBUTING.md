Contributing to VALJOGen
========================

Contributors and contributions are welcome. Here is a quick guide.

#1. Implementation details for the project.
See [readme in annotaton processor project](../../tree/master/valjogen-processor/README.md) for implementation details.

In addition these two 2 eclipse plugins may be useful to update readme pages in GitHub Flavored Markdown (`.md`):

#3. Getting your changes accepted.

Push to your fork and submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). I will then look at your changes
and promote them if I agree. If your work is good and we agree on the overal goal, design and code conventions, then you can also
subsequently becomme a contributor with push rights.

    Finally, agree/sign a Contributor License Agreement.

It might be necessary for you to sign/agree to a contributor License Agreement. I haven't ironed that out yet - let me know if you
have any ideas. Otherwise I will find out when necessary.
