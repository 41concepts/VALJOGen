v2.0.0 of VALJOGen uploaded to maven central with following changes:

+ Support for [jackson-annotations](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-annotations) to support conversions to/from JSON. Enable with VALJOConfigure.dataConversion.
* Generic support for adding custom annotations to members, methods, properties (+ constructors and class itself).
+ Explicit specification of mutable/immutable output can now be enforced with VALJOConfigure.mutability.
+ Generation of additional constructors and factory methods for mutable objects that has setters (incl. default constructor if all properties have setters).
+ Custom-templates can now check for typeOf, method existence, field existence and java target version which is handy for advanced code generation.
+ Pretty print of internal models which is useful for debugging custom-templates etc. (set logLevel to INFO to see them).
+ Various internal changes, updates to examples and small bug fixes.

A few model and configuration changes are not 100% backwards-compatible, hence the major version increment. Let me know if you run into problems.
